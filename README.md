# 🌟 Personal Portfolio - Astro + EmDash CMS

A modern, responsive personal portfolio website built with **Astro** featuring a vintage letter theme with elegant animations. Content is managed through **EmDash CMS** — a full-stack, Astro-native CMS with a visual admin panel, backed by SQLite.

## 📋 Project Overview

This portfolio showcases skills, projects, and experience with a unique letter/postal theme, smooth animations, and interactive elements. All content is editable through the EmDash admin panel at `/_emdash/admin`, with local JSON files serving as a fallback.

## ✨ Features

- **About Me** - Combined profile card and letter format
- **Skills** - Vintage postage stamp design with skill categories
- **Projects** - Browser mockup cards with horizontal scrolling carousel
- **Experience** - Letter-styled experience cards
- **Contact** - Contact information section

### Design Highlights
- Vintage letter and postal theme throughout
- Smooth scroll animations and transitions
- Interactive floating sparkles
- Responsive design for all devices
- Custom wavy borders and postal elements

### CMS Highlights
- Visual admin panel at `/_emdash/admin`
- Live content collections — edits appear without rebuilding
- SQLite database (local) with JSON fallback
- All 5 content types editable from the admin UI

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 22.12.0
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

The admin panel is available at `http://localhost:4321/_emdash/admin`.  
The first visit will prompt you to create an admin account.

```bash

npm start
```

## 📝 Content Management

Content is managed through the **EmDash admin panel**. After running `npm run bootstrap` and starting the dev server, go to:

```
http://localhost:4321/_emdash/admin
```

### Collections

| Collection | Fields |
|------------|--------|
| Profile | First/last name, title, intro, about paragraphs, birthday, degree, location, email, specialization, skills description |
| Projects | Title, description, URL, icon, tags, display order |
| Skills | Name, category (core/tools), Font Awesome icon, display order |
| Experience | Job title, company, date range, display order |
| Contact | Email, phone, GitHub, LinkedIn, resume link |

### How it works

1. Run `npm run bootstrap` once to set up the database and seed initial content
2. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`
3. Open `/_emdash/admin` and log in
4. Edit any collection — changes appear live without a rebuild

The `seed/seed.json` file is the single source of truth for both schema and default content. If EmDash is unreachable, components automatically read the seeded values from it instead.

## 🌐 Deployment

The site now runs as a **Node.js server** (not static). It requires a persistent filesystem for the SQLite database and uploaded media.

### Node.js hosts (Railway, Render, Fly.io, etc.)

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start          # runs bootstrap then starts the server
```

Set `PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR` to a mounted volume path to keep the database and uploads across deploys.

### Vercel / serverless

Serverless platforms don't support persistent SQLite. For those, either:
- Use a remote database adapter (Turso/libSQL, PostgreSQL) — see EmDash docs
- Or keep the static JSON files as the sole content source and revert `output` to `"static"` in `astro.config.mjs`
